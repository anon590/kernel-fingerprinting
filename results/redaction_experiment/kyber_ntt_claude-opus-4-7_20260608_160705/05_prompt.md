## Task: kyber_ntt

Batched forward Cooley-Tukey NTT over a small prime field for a negacyclic polynomial ring Z_q[X] / (X^n + 1). Each polynomial has length n; the modulus q, the polynomial length n, the number of NTT stages n_levels, and the precomputed twiddle table are all bound at runtime so a single kernel runs every parameter set the host supplies.

Convention (matches the FIPS 203 / FIPS 204 / pqclean reference C implementations):
  k = 1
  for level = 0..n_levels:
      len = n >> (level + 1)
      for start = 0, 2*len, ..., n - 2*len:
          z = zetas[k++]
          for j = start..start + len - 1:
              t          = (z * a[j+len]) mod q
              a[j+len]   = (a[j] - t)       mod q
              a[j]       = (a[j] + t)       mod q
Equivalent per-thread mapping (ltid in [0, n/2) owns one butterfly per level):
  group_idx   = ltid / len
  j_in_group  = ltid - group_idx * len   (= ltid mod len)
  j           = (group_idx << 1) * len + j_in_group
  zeta_index  = (1 << level) + group_idx

Zetas table (host-precomputed, length 1 << n_levels):
  zetas[k] = zeta^bit_reverse(k, n_levels)  mod q
where zeta is a primitive 2^(n_levels+1)-th root of unity in F_q. The forward NTT consumes zetas[1..(1 << n_levels) - 1] in increasing index order; zetas[0] = 1 is the unread identity element.

Bounds for kernel design: q fits in a 32-bit unsigned integer; n is a power of two with n <= 256; n_levels <= 8 (so the zetas table has at most 256 entries). The kernel MUST read q, n, and n_levels from their bound buffers and load every twiddle from the zetas buffer at runtime; compile-time constants for any of these values are incorrect.

Storage: ``uint32`` per coefficient, in-place. The host writes the input coefficients into ``coeffs`` and reads the result back from the same buffer; ``coeffs`` is (batch * n) uint values in row-major order (polynomial p's coefficients live at offsets p*n .. p*n + n - 1).

All inputs are canonical: a[i] in [0, q). Outputs MUST also be canonical -- a value in [q, 2^32) with the same residue class still counts as a mismatch on the bit-exact reference comparison.

## Required kernel signature(s)

```
kernel void kyber_ntt(
    device       uint *coeffs     [[buffer(0)]],
    device const uint *zetas      [[buffer(1)]],
    constant uint     &q           [[buffer(2)]],
    constant uint     &n           [[buffer(3)]],
    constant uint     &n_levels    [[buffer(4)]],
    constant uint     &batch       [[buffer(5)]],
    uint tgid [[threadgroup_position_in_grid]],
    uint ltid [[thread_position_in_threadgroup]]);

Dispatch (host-provided):
  threadsPerGrid        = (batch * (n/2), 1, 1)
  threadsPerThreadgroup = (n/2, 1, 1)
Each threadgroup owns ONE polynomial; tgid in [0, batch) selects the polynomial, ltid in [0, n/2) owns one butterfly per level. Every test size uses n = 256, so n/2 = 128 threads per threadgroup is sufficient; a static threadgroup scratch of size 256 covers every case. Threadgroup-cooperative and simdgroup schemes are valid as long as the buffer layout and the canonical-output contract are preserved.
```
